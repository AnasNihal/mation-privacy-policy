  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 8, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Zorcha</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
    use, disclose, and protect information when you use our web application, services, and any
    integrations with third-party platforms (such as Meta, Instagram, and Facebook APIs).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use Zorcha, we may collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> such as your name, email address, and authentication details provided through Clerk or other login services.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> analytics data including pages visited, actions taken, and time spent on our platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party Integrations:</strong> if you connect your Meta or Instagram account, we may access limited data such as your user ID, profile name, and insights, strictly according to the permissions you grant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the core functionality of Zorcha SaaS.</li>
    <li>Enable integrations with Meta and other platforms for features like analytics or automation.</li>
    <li>Authenticate users securely via Clerk.</li>
    <li>Communicate updates, service information, and technical notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information.  
    Data is shared only with trusted services necessary for our operation, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hosting and database providers (e.g., Vercel, Prisma, Supabase).</li>
    <li>Authentication providers (e.g., Clerk).</li>
    <li>APIs you connect (e.g., Meta, Instagram) — only for features you explicitly enable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users’ safety.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain user data for as long as your account remains active or as necessary to provide our services.
    You may delete your account at any time, after which all data will be removed within 30 days from our
    servers and backups.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Deletion Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Users can request deletion of their data by emailing us at
    <a href="mailto:support@zorcha.com">support@zorcha.com</a> or by visiting our
    <a href="https://zorcha.com/delete-account">Data Deletion page</a> (if available).
    Upon verification, we will delete all related information from our systems and integrated services
    within 30 days.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized
    access, loss, misuse, or disclosure. However, no system is 100% secure, and we encourage users to use
    strong passwords and keep their login credentials private.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Zorcha does not knowingly collect data from individuals under the age of 16. If we become aware that
    we have inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated
    via email or notice on our website before taking effect.
